# Tarkam of Madness
Tarkam of Madness is a web based multiplayer game. We were inspired from soccer game in our village. In tarkam soccer game, sometimes we ignore game rules and don't focus on winning the game but on tackling the enemy. So, this game is kind of like that. In this game, we don't only focus to make a goal but also to disturb our enemy to make a goal by hitting them and grab the ball.
